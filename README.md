# Snake-DQN

Snake-DQN is a program created using TensorFlow and Keras and uses the famous Deep Q-Learning method to train a simple CNN agent to play the game of snake.
To play the game of snake, run :
```
python3 env.py
```

To train an agent, run :
```
python3 train_agent.py
```

To test a trained agent, run :
